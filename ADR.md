To provide NPM compatibility for installation, a package manager like JSR would need to implement these key registry API endpoints:

1. Package metadata endpoint: `GET /[package-name]`

   - Returns package information including versions, dependencies, and dist information
   - Critical for npm to resolve the package and its dependencies

2. Package version endpoint: `GET /[package-name]/[version]`

   - Returns metadata for a specific version of the package

3. Package tarball endpoint: `GET /[package-name]/-/[package-name]-[version].tgz`

   - Provides the actual tarball file for download
   - This is where npm retrieves the package content from

These endpoints form the minimal set required to allow npm install commands to work properly. The registry must respond with proper headers and tarball content that matches npm's expectations for format and structure.

Would you like more details about any specific endpoint implementation or other aspects of npm compatibility?
